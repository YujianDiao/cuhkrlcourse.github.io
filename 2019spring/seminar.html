<p><b>Some suggestions</b> for preparing the presentation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Decide exactly which material you will cover, and let Bolei know well ahead of time so that he can assign papers to the class.</li>
  <li>Decide how you will present the material. What is the methology, data, experiments, and conclusion. Why this work is exciting. How people can be inspired by this work. Try to get the class involved.</li>
  <li>Prepare your presentation well. Practice and make sure that you will be presenting for the appropriate amount of time. You should understand the material that you are covering very well and be able to answer questions about it.</li>
  <li>Slide will be shared and made public after the class. Students will grade each other's presentation.</li>
</ul>
